There are 6 major instruments that are absolutely free to use:
- **<ins>[Waves Explorer](#waves-explorer)</ins>**<br>
    Online service that allows you to browse the Waves blockchain data.<br>
- **<ins>[Signer]()</ins>**<br>
    A TypeScript/JavaScript library featuring signing and broadcasting transactions on users behalf.<br> 
- **<ins>[Waves IDE](#waves-ide)</ins>**<br>

    Libraries intended for creation, signing, broadcasting [transactions](#linktotransactionlesson), and reading data from the Waves blockchain.
- **<ins>[IDE Plugins](#ide-plugins)</ins>**<br>
    
### Waves Explorer ###

If you would like to browse the Waves blockchain data, the [Waves Explorer](https://new.wavesexplorer.com/) is the correct place for that.<br>
Please, keep in mind that all the blockchain data can exist within 3 major [Waves networks (Mainnet, Testnet, and Stagenet)]().<br>
As well, it can be any [custom blockchain network](https://docs.waves.tech/en/waves-node/private-waves-network) you can create.<br>
<br>
All the information you would be able to see on the screen would depend on the chosen network:<br><br>

- **<ins>See the Waves blockchain statistics</ins>**:<br>

-  **<ins>Search transactions, accounts, tokens, blocks details</ins>**:

### Signer ###

Signer is a tool that grants integration of payments with WAVES in any other service.<br>
The best way to describe how Signer works is to do it with an example.<br>
<br>
Let's imagine that we manage a online pizza delivery.<br>
We don't want to accept any payments except with the WAVES cryptocurrency.<br>
In case we want to receive WAVES to our cryptowallet, we have 2 options:

- Write down the requisites of our wallet and ask a client to transfer tokens there:<br>
    ![](./images/signer_no.png)<br>
- Integrate payment service that would allow clients to pay with a few clicks:<br>
    ![](./images/signer_yes.png)<br>

As we may have guessed, the first option is an outdated method.<br>
It puts our business at risk, as some clients can change their minds to order due to payment complexity.<br>
Secondly, some clients may experience troubles with proving the payment completed.<br>
<br>

The second option is what the Signer is about.<br>
It helps us to integrate a service
