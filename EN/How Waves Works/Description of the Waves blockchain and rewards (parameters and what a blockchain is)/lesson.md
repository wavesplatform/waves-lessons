## Description ##
As we previously discussed it in the "1. Introduction" chapter, the blockchain is the chain of unique blocks, containg immutable data in it. The major goal of using a blockchain is to have immutable data inside of it that cannot be compromised. 


Waves is an open blockchain protocol that allows you to:
- Work with transacations;
- Receive rewards for block generation and leasing.
