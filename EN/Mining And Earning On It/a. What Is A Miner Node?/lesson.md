## Module Intro ##

This module will open the door to the world of mining with Waves.<br>
Firstly we will define what a [mining node](#miner-node-definition) is and discover what nodes can do.<br>
Afterward, [rewards for the blocks generation]() will be elaborated.<br>
Last, but not the least, point is learnig how to [setup a node]() on different operating systems.<br>
By the end of this module, you would be able to deploy your own node and be able to earn with mining.<br>

## Miner Node Definition ##

In the lesson [Nodes Of The Waves Network](), we gave a definition to node and described major features of it.<br>
Let's  recap what we have just learned about it with a few short sentences.<br>
A node is a device (computer) that is connected to a [Waves network (Mainnet, Stagenet, Testnet)]().<br>
Every node is participating in the process of validation of new blocks and transactions.<br>
Some nodes can also receive the right of block generation, which grants to the generating node owner a reward for every block generated.<br>
Within this and the following lesson, [Summary Of Mining Node Requirements](), it will be our major task to find out how exactly we can receive that block generation right and receive profit from it.<br>

It is worth to mention that with Waves, you are mining with a [LPoS consensus]().<br>
In the lesson [Introduction - Blockchain, Transactions, etc](), there was given an example of [LPoS consensus]().<br>
What it means is that you don't need to have an extremly powerful computer to generate a block and get a reward.<br>
Every time there is only one block generator and not thousands of competing computers as it works with [PoW consensus]().<br>
Basically, you may have one casual computer or a laptop on which you can deploy a node.<br>
There are certain [requirements for block generation]() that you need to satisfy to generate a block.<br>
If your node generates a block, you receive a [reward](#rewards-for-blocks-generation) for it in the wallet of that node.<br>

## Rewards For Blocks Generation ##

The reward for block generation is not static.<br>
At the current moment, the reward amount is 6 WAVES.<br>
It may change with [voting](https://docs.waves.tech/en/blockchain/mining/mining-reward#voting), both decreasing or increasing.<br>


The next lesson will cover the [requirements]() for deployment a node and block generation.<br>
