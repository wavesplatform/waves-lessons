## Module Intro ##

This module will open the door to the world of mining with Waves.  
Firstly we will define what a [mining node](#miner-node-definition) is and discover what nodes can do.  
Afterward, [rewards for the blocks generation]() will be elaborated.  
Last, but not the least, point is learnig how to [setup a node]() on different operating systems.  
By the end of this module, you would be able to deploy your own node and be able to earn with mining.

## Miner Node Definition ##

In the lesson [Nodes Of The Waves Network](), we gave a definition to node and described major features of it.  
Let's  recap what we have just learned about it with a few short sentences.  
A node is a device (computer) that is connected to a [Waves network (Mainnet, Stagenet, Testnet)]().  
Every node is participating in the process of validation of new blocks and transactions.  
Some nodes can also receive the right of block generation, which grants to the generating node owner a reward for every block generated.  
Within this and the following lesson, [Summary Of Mining Node Requirements](), it will be our major task to find out how exactly we can receive that block generation right and receive profit from it.  

It is worth to mention that with Waves, you are mining with a [LPoS consensus]().  
In the lesson [Introduction - Blockchain, Transactions, etc](), there was given an example of [LPoS consensus]().  
What it means is that you don't need to have an extremly powerful computer to generate a block and get a reward.  
Every time there is only one block generator and not thousands of competing computers as it works with [PoW consensus]().  
Basically, you may have one casual computer or a laptop on which you can deploy a node.  
There are certain [requirements for block generation]() that you need to satisfy to generate a block.  
If your node generates a block, you receive a [reward](#rewards-for-blocks-generation) for it in the wallet of that node.

## Rewards For Blocks Generation ##

The reward for block generation is not static.  
At the current moment, the reward amount is 6 WAVES.  
It may change with [voting](https://docs.waves.tech/en/blockchain/mining/mining-reward#voting), both decreasing or increasing.  


The next lesson will cover the [requirements]() for deployment a node and block generation.
