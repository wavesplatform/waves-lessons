## Asset definition ##

An asset (or a token) is a digital resource that can be used as:
- **<u>Cryptocurrency</u>**:  
        Aside from the main Waves blockchain cryptocurrency, WAVES, you can create your own cryptocurrency.
        If you manage to promote your token in the market, it can become a valuable currency. 
        To give a hint on how to make your currency valuable, take a look at dollars.
        Why do we use dollars and think of them as of something that has a value?
        Why, at the same time, do we never use leaves from trees as a currency, though it may have a relatively the same composition?
        Dollars managed to be credited to accounts of many different holders, and the holders had no other goal but to use these dollars.
        As people searched for ways to use dollars, they started exchanging them for goods and services.
        The more people and the more frequent dollars are used, the bigger its value is becoming.
        The rest depends on the currency creator.
- **<u>Object</u>**:  
        An object can be represented as an auxiliatry tool.
        The best way to grasp this idea is to see it working on the live example.
        For instance, you can create a cookery game, using the Waves blockchain as your database.
        In that game your goal is to generate recipes.
        Every account of the game is the Waves blockchain [account]().
        To generate a recipe, you spin a wheel and receive a reward recipe.
        Every wheel spin costs one [token that we created](#asset-creation).
        All users can receive three free tokens every 24 hours.
        Here we use tokens that we created on the Waves blockchain as an object in the game that we created.

Therefore, we can make a conclusion that an asset can be either a cryptocurrency or an object within your program.
If you wish to become an owner of a new cryptocurrency, you can [create it](#asset-creation) on the Waves blockchain.
After creation, the destiny of this asset will be totally in your hands.
Likewise, you can also use assets as a ready solution for your projects.

In the topic [How the Waves works](), we covered the lesson on smart assets, [What is a smart asset, and how to create it]().
That lesson was a simple particular demonstration of what a smart asset is and how it could be created. The difference between a regular asset and a smart asset is that a smart asset has an additional configuration, defining rules of work of the asset.
