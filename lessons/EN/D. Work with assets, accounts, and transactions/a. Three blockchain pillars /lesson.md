## Three blockchain pillars ##

Within the Waves blockchain, there are three important pillars upon which the blockchain stands:
- [Account]()  
   It is not possible to make any action on the blockchain without an account. An account is a subject **WHO** makes an action.
- [Asset]()  
    An asset is **WHAT** often happens to be the object of this action. Yet, there are certain operations that do not necessarily interact with assets. For example, an account can [create an alias](), where any action with an asset is absent. Nevertheless, the major goal of a blockchain is to be an immutable ledger, where the indispensable element is an asset. 
- [Transaction]()  
    A transaction is itself an **ACTION** on the blockchain. 

The targets of this module are:
- To reveal definitions and subtleties of [assets](), [accounts](), and [transactions]();
- To demonstrate relevant code examples operating with them written in different programming languages.

In the lesson [Asset creation and operation with assets](), we will talk about assets, and as an example, we will create a regular asset and an NFT.
